# About The Project

## Usage

With this project, we want to create a system that can distribute requests from clients.
With that being said, we want to distribute all the "work" to multiple processors, to avoid
the load imbalance between the multiple machines.
After this, we want to store all the clients requests on a storage layer, each one with a specific
and unique identifier. Clients, can check their appliance status all the time, near the processor that was chosen to process the request.
